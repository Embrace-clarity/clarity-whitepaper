# Embrace Clarity Whitepaper 0.1

## Summary

Clarity is an open source and open hardware decentralised communication device that will be built for society, not profit. It will be the first mobile device\(an ecosystem of devices in the future\) that will support Ethereum Network and IPFS natively.

Clarity will give a platform for dapps that run on the Ethereum Network, and a single NFC enabled wallet. Its operating system Atmosphere OS will be modular, which means that each module will collaborate with other modules to create a consistent and coherent experience. A new era deserves a new platform.

It won’t be just about developers. We have a clear mission of breaking the consumer chain by establishing a fully autonomous Dapp Store which will be maintained by the community.

Clarity will have its own token called AIR, it will be used for rewards Where users will become members of communities of different modules where they can be rewarded for their contribution \(submitting bugs, helping others, improving the product, reviewing modules, etc.\).

Each device will come with a multipurpose docking station called Air Dock which will serve as an Ethereum Node, charger, home assistant, with an option for a desktop module so people can use Clarity as a workstation.

## Atmosphere OS

We’ve been stuck in the app era for a decade since the iPhone came out. Big corporations took advantage of the platforms and began to [trap human within their products](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/04/twitter-accounts-really-are-echo-chambers-study-finds). The core mission of Atmosphere is to bring back clarity in people's lifes. By nateively supporting dat, ethereum, ipfs and other decentralised networks we can avoid the creation of echo chambers and therefor be who we decide to be rather than corporations shaping our thoughts.

The system will be focused on simplifing the experience for humans by eliminating the need for stanalone apps. Instead Atmosphere will use Layers where developers can build Modules on top which elimantes the need of a UI / UX design. 

### What are Layers?

The system will be sliced in few layers where developers can build on top rather than creating standalone solutions.  


Type of Layers:

* **Transportation** - Build everything from maps to decentralised uber, citymapper, etc. For exmaple you can go to Maps search for a restorant and decide how you want to interact with that location \(ordering food, getting directions, booking a ticket, etc\) without leaving maps.
* **Payments** - A digital wallet allowing people to exchange values withing the platform and with the outside world through NFC. Each Module in the OS can have their own token which will automatically be added to the wallet. For exmaple if you use and contribute to a module \(giving feedback, development, etc.\) you can rewarded for being a member of its community.
* **Communication** - A decentralised p2p messaging platform where developers can build different modules to enhance the experiece. For exmaple video streaming, stickers, payments etc. all can be build seperately by different developers without the need of standalone apps.
* **Audio / Video \(Unclear\)** - P2P exchange of audo and video files. 

### Modules Store

Users will become members of communities of different modules where they can be rewarded for their contribution such as

* Submitting bugs and issues to the development team
* Acting as a support agent
* Improving the product by suggesting features and upvoting \(small transactions\) when they want a feature built
* Reviewing modules and making sure they are safe for public use.
* Helping the community grow through social campaigns and marketing
* Developers can grab the most wanted feature and build it and receive the bounty reward

### Crowdsale

Module Store will aim at streamlining the Crowdsale and make it as simple as submitting and app on Apple App Store or campaign on Kick Starter. Developers and organisations will be able to submit even apps which are in early stage of development to allow the community to build organic value and impact before it’s ready. Even allow concept based modules to form a team and community based on just an idea.

All members of Atmosphere will be able to seamlessly purchase a token in Crowdsale through the unified wallet without worrying about compatibility.

Continues transparency throughout the campaign without having to bounce between Medium, Etherscan:

* Updates from the developers
* How fair distribution is
* When the campaign is ending
* Clear guidelines to participate

## Hardware modules

Hardware engineers will be able to build on top of the platform and sell and distribute through the ambassador’s network.

Each piece of hardware will attach seamlessly to the bottom of the device.

## Air Dock

Air Dock will act as a charging station, wifi mesh-network router and node on the Ethereum network. Contributing to the overall decentralisation mission.

The dock will be modular as well and allow extra functionality to be added such as

* Wireless modules \(Wireless Alarm clocks\)
* Home Assistant
* TV
* Desktop

# Fair distribution of value and full transparency

Business between service providers and suppliers has always been happening under the table. Often deals might involve human rights violations, from the \(real\)miners to factories that mould the materials, to workers on the assembly line.

With the blockchain will be able to trace who produced what and make sure this person is paid fairly every time a Clarity device is sold. The buyer will have the choice to pick a manufacturer based on their reputation.

The same logic applies to everything, GitHub contributions, designers, marketers, engineers, etc.

# Production & Maintenance

Open Hardware will enable everyone to participate in the production of the device. From handmade crafted to 3D printed and machine manufactured devices. Unified guidelines will make sure that devices are safe and compatible with the rest of the eco system.

# Distribution & Education and Marketing

All products will be distributed by the community itself. Brand ambassadors, distributors and teachers will be rewarded with tokens.
