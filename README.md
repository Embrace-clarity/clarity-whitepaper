# Whitepaper 0.1

## Summary
Clarity is an open source and open hardware decentralised communication device that will be build for society, not profit. It will be the first mobile device(an ecosystem of devices in the future) that will support Ethereum Network and IPFS natively. 

Clarity will give a platform for dapps that run on the Ethereum Network, and a single NFC enabled wallet. Its operating system Atmosphere OS will be modular, which means that each module will collaborate with other modules to create a consistent and coherent experience. A new era deserves a new platform.

It won’t be just about developers. We have a clear mission of breaking the consumer chain by establishing a fully autonomous Dapp Store which will be maintained by the community.

Clarity will have its own token called AIR, it will be used for rewards Where users will becomes members of communities of different modules where they can be rewarded for their contribution (submitting bugs, helping others, improving the product, reviewing modules, etc.).

Each device will come with a multi-purpose docking station called Air Dock which will serve as an Ethereum Node, charger, home assistant, with an option for a desktop module so people can use Clarity as a workstation.

## Atmosphere OS

### Layers
The system will be sliced in few layers where developers can build on top rather than creating standalone solutions.
Type of Layers:
- **Transportation** - Build everything from maps to decentralised uber, citymapper, etc. 
- **Payments** - Software and hardware development will possible. Enabling merchants and customers to exchange value through.
- **Communication** - Send stickers 
- **Audio / Video** - Streaming music from your friends or applying filters to your photos won’t require running separate apps.

### Modules
We’ve been stuck in the app era for a decade since the iPhone came out. It was a huge revolution, and it actually changed the meaning of a mobile phone. It expanded 
Modules are sort of extensions on top of each Layer. Adding extra functionality and enhancing the experience of the platform.

### Modules Store
Users will become members of communities of different modules where they can be rewarded for their contribution such as
- Submitting bugs and issues to the development team
- Acting like a support agent
- Improving the product by suggesting features and upvoting (small transactions) when they want a feature built
- Reviewing modules and making sure they are safe for public use.
- Helping the community grow through social campaigns and marketing
- Developers can grab the most wanted feature and build it and receive the bounty reward

### Crowdsale
Module Store will aim at streamlining the Crowdsale and make it as simple as submitting and app on Apple App Store or campaign on Kick Starter. Developers and organisations will be able to submit even apps which are in early stage of development to allow the community to build organic value and impact before it’s ready. Even allow concept based modules to form a team and community based on just an idea.

All members of Atmosphere will be able to seamlessly purchase a token in Crowdsale through the unified wallet without worrying about compatibility. 

Continues transparency throughout the campaign without having to bounce between Medium, Etherscan:
- Updates from the developers
- How fair distribution is
- When the campaign is ending
- Clear guidelines to participate

## Hardware modules
Hardware engineers will be able to build on top of the platform and sell and distribute through the ambassador’s network.

Each piece of hardware will attach seamlessly to the bottom of the device. 

## Air Dock
Air Dock will act as a charging station, wifi mesh-network router and node on the Ethereum network. Contributing to the overall decentralisation mission.

The dock will be modular as well and allow extra functionality to be added such as 
- Wireless modules (Wireless Alarm clocks)
- Home Assistant
- TV
- Desktop

# Fair distribution of value and full transparency

Business between service providers and suppliers has always been happening under the table. Often deals might involve human expatiation, from the (real)miners to factories that mold the materials, to workers on the assembly line.

With the blockchain will be able to trace who produced what and make sure this person is paid fairly every time a Clarity device is sold. The buyer will have the choice to pick a manufacturer based on their reputation.

The same logic applies to everything, GitHub contributions, designers, marketers, engineers, etc.

# Production & Maintenance
Open Hardware will enable everyone to participate in the production of the device. From handmade crafted to 3D printed and machine manufactured devices. Unified guidelines will make sure that devices are safe and compatible with the rest of the eco system.

# Distribution & Education and Marketing
All products will be distributed by the community itself. Brand ambassadors, distributors and teachers will be rewarded with tokens.
